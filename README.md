Within this project there are three packages, each of which does a different thing. A package named "zadatak1" checks if a word is entered as a palindrome, where spaces are not counted. The package named "zadatak2" requires the client to request the server to list all the files in DATA_SERVER folder and to select from the list which files it wants to transfer from the DATA_SERVER to the folder DATA_KLIJENT. At the end is a package named "zadatak3" called "Sequence 3x3". It's a game where randomly the buttons are colored orange and then they have to be clicked in the same order as they are colored orange. The game is repeated when the start button is pressed again.
